🔍 Deep EDA Insights
1️⃣ Content Growth Over Time
Netflix saw a sharp rise in content post-2015, aligning with its aggressive international expansion.
The peak was around 2018–2020, after which growth plateaued—indicating a shift from volume to quality-driven strategy.
2️⃣ Movies vs TV Shows
Movies account for nearly 70% of total content, while TV shows are growing steadily.
This indicates an opportunity to invest further in episodic content to increase binge-watching retention.
3️⃣ Geographic Distribution 🌍
The U.S. dominates content production, but countries like India, South Korea, and the U.K. are rapidly contributing.
Local-language originals are proving to be key growth drivers in regional markets.
4️⃣ Genre Trends
Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries top the charts globally.
Thrillers and Crime content have shown consistent demand—suggesting viewers seek engagement-driven narratives.
5️⃣ Ratings Analysis
A significant portion of content is rated TV-MA (Mature Audience), reflecting Netflix’s appeal to adult viewers.
However, the family/children segment is underrepresented, signaling untapped market potential.
💡 Business Insights & Recommendations
✅ Invest in Regional Originals
Expand aggressively in India, South Korea, Africa, and Latin America by producing culturally resonant originals.
✅ Balanced Portfolio
Shift from a movies-heavy catalog to more TV shows, capitalizing on binge-worthy content that drives retention.
✅ Diversify Genres
Strengthen investments in family entertainment, kids’ shows, and educational content to widen the subscriber base.
✅ Localized Marketing Strategies
Tailor recommendations and promotions regionally to enhance personalization and user engagement.
✅ Sustainability in Growth
Instead of scaling content volume rapidly, focus on high-quality productions with global appeal (e.g., Squid Game).
🎯 Key Takeaway
Netflix’s success lies not just in being a content provider, but in being a data-driven storyteller. By aligning its catalog with evolving audience demands and regional trends, it can sustain its leadership in the OTT space.
